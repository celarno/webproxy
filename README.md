# webproxy

This simple web proxy written in Python basically scrapes a publicly available proxy list,
sorts and filters it, and changes the current system's HTTP(s) settings accordingly.

It requires the following packages: BeautifulSoup, Pandas and PyQt5 - and works currently only on OS X/MacOS.

(The code is not complete, so I just uploaded the Jupyter notebook for the purpose of illustration.)
